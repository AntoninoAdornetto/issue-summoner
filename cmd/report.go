Issue annotations can be as simple as @TODO or any other value that you seefit. 
The only requirement is that the annotation resides in a single or multi line comment. 
Once issue annotations are discovered, you will be presented with a list of all the issues 
that were located and you can select which ones you would like to report to a source code management
platform.`,
