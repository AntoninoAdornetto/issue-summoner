The c.go file is responsible for satisfying the `LexicalTokenizer` interface in the `lexer.go` file.
The methods are a strict set of rules for handling single & multi line comments for c-like languages.
The result, if an issue annotation is located, is a slice of tokens that will provide information about
the action item contained in the comment. If a comment does not contain an issue annotation, all subsequent
tokens of the remaining comment bytes will be ignored and removed from the `DraftTokens` slice.
